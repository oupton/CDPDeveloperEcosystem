#### Device Onboarding

This section includes documentation, videos, and client code with information to onboard a device with CDP. We have documented the process for the following devices:
- Raspberry Pi, Eclipse Leshan Client (Java)
- Bosch XDK110, Bosch LWM2M Client (C)
- NXP LPC1768 mbed Device, Eclipse Wakaama Client (C)
- NXP FRDM-K64F mbed Device, Eclipse Wakaama Client (C/C++)

Beyond these devices, you may connect any device that supports the Java Runtime (1.7 or greater) with the Leshan client. Eclipse Wakaama is designed to be POSIX-compliant,
and as such can be ported to many *nix environments

#### NBI API Demos

This section includes some sample code (Java) that demonstrates how to interact with CDP's REST APIs to modify devices and execute jobs.
